      "When I heard Chris was starting up Velo Tech Centre as a dedicated workshop it was great news. I entrust my bikes only to the very best, and Chris is that. From a maintenance perspective, whenever Chris works on my bikes I walk away both knowing the problem has been resolved and having had the issue identified and explained. For new builds, Chris nails it ... every time. His attention to detail and build finish is exceptional and his pricing for both maintenance and parts is very competitive. Thanks, VeloTech.",

      "Velo Tech has the skills, technical knowledge and equipment to make sure my bike runs its best. I am always struck by the variety of work Chris has in his workshop when I'm there. Whether it's building the latest Trek for a client or researching retro parts for a bespoke steel frame project, Chris' knowledge is endless. He is also a great communicator, always telling me exactly what he's done with my bike in fine detail. And even though I don't understand what he means half the time, I really appreciate knowing how much he cares. Thanks Velo Tech!",
